## Project Dashboards
**Executive Dashboard –** This dashboard provides a high-level overview of key business metrics. It likely includes KPIs, trends, and visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and cards to track performance.
**Map Visualization –** This visualization represents geographical data using a map. It could be showing sales by region, customer distribution, or any other location-based insights.
**Customer Details Dashboard –** A detailed view of customer-related metrics, possibly including customer demographics, purchase behavior, and segmentation analysis.
**Product Details Dashboard –** A focused report on product performance, likely showing sales trends, revenue distribution, and inventory insights per product category.
**Tooltip Feature –** A tooltip-enabled visualization providing additional insights when hovering over data points. This could be used to show more details without cluttering the main report.
**Decomposition Tree –** A Power BI decomposition tree visualization that breaks down a key metric (e.g., sales, revenue) into hierarchical levels, allowing users to explore contributing factors dynamically.
**Key Influencer Visualization –** This Power BI feature identifies key factors that influence a particular metric (e.g., what drives sales or customer retention), using AI-driven analysis.
